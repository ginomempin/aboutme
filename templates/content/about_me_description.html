    I'm a Senior Software Engineer currently based in Japan.

<p>
    My
    <a
      href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ginomempin/"
      target="_blank">work experience</a>
    is quite diverse. Right now, I'm developing embedded and cloud-based applications
    using Python, C++, ROS, and AWS. In the past, I've worked on other kinds
    of projects such as desktop applications for Windows/Mac using C++ and wxWidgets,
    Android and iOS applications, and simple web applications using PHP and AngularJS.
</p>
<p>
    When it comes to work, I believe in continuous learning and self-improvement, keeping it
    <a

      target="_blank">DRY</a>,
    using the right tool for the job, "<i>leaving the campground cleaner than
    the way you found it</i>", and using spaces over tabs.
</p>
<p>
    I do a bit of
    <a

      target="_blank">photography</a>
    as a way of capturing the memorable experiences from places I've been to.
    It's also a great way to motivate myself to get out more often and to get
    a bit of exercise.

<p>
    I also like to

    and when I'm not out on a photowalk or glued to a keyboard working on some
    <a

      target="_blank">side project</a>,
    I usually unwind by retreating into a book with a hot cup of tea and a pack
    of chocolate chip cookies.
</p>
<p>
    I enjoy eating spicy food, sushi, dark chocolate, pineapples, and almost anything
    that has cheese in it.
