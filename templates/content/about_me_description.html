    I'm a Senior Software Engineer currently based in Japan.

<p>
    My
    <a
      href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ginomempin/"
      target="_blank">work experience</a>
    is quite diverse. Right now, I'm developing embedded and cloud-based apps
    using Python, C++, Vue.js, and AWS. In the past, I've worked on desktop apps
    for Windows/Mac using C++ and wxWidgets, Android and iOS mobile apps, and
    simple web apps using PHP and AngularJS.

<p>
    When it comes to work, I believe in continuous learning and self-improvement, keeping it
    <a

      target="_blank">DRY</a>,
    using the right tool for the job, "<i>leaving the campground cleaner than
    the way you found it</i>", and using spaces over tabs.
</p>
<p>
    I do a bit of
    <a

    as a way of motivating myself to get out more often and to get a bit of
    exercise. It's a great way to unplug and to reboot my brain after a long,
    hard week.

<p>
    I also like to

    and when I'm not out on a photowalk or glued to a keyboard working on some
    <a

      target="_blank">side project</a>,
    I usually spend my time retreating into a book while drinking some hot tea
    and munching on a pack of chocolate chip cookies.

<p>
    I enjoy eating spicy food, sushi, dark chocolate, pineapples, and almost anything
    that has cheese in it.
